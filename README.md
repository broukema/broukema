You should [shift your repositories off github](https://archive.vn/U1R2L), because Github

* favours propietary software; 
* was bought by [GAFAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAFAM), the authoritarian oligopoly; 
* [violates](https://archive.today/9atnl) scientific [ethics](https://archive.today/ZtNcK)
* [Give up GitHub: the time has come!](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/jun/30/give-up-github-launch) - Software Freedom Conservancy, 2022-06-30
  * [discussion at ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31932250)

My own shift is incomplete; you can find several of my git repositories at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/boud) .

See Fedeproxy at https://fedeproxy.eu for an ongoing project to enable easy communication across independent community-based software forges (such as git repository host servers).
