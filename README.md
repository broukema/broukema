You should [shift your repositories off github](https://archive.vn/U1R2L), because Github

* favours propietary software;
* was bought by [GAFAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAFAM), the authoritarian oligopoly;
* [violates](https://archive.today/9atnl) scientific [ethics](https://archive.today/ZtNcK)

On 2022-06-30, the Software Freedom Conservancy called to:
* [Give up GitHub: the time has come!](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/jun/30/give-up-github-launch)
  * [discussion at ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31932250)

My own shift is incomplete, with some repositories still remaining on github; you can find several of my live git repositories at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/boud) .

See ``forgefriends`` at https://forgefriends.org for an ongoing project to enable easy communication across independent community-based software forges (such as git repository host servers);
