You should [shift your repositories off github](https://archive.vn/U1R2L), because Github

* favours propietary software; 
* was bought by [GAFAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAFAM), the authoritarian oligopoly; 
* [violates](https://archive.vn/o/U1R2L/https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-and-trade-controls) scientific [ethics](https://archive.vn/o/U1R2L/https://council.science/what-we-do/freedoms-and-responsibilities-of-scientists)

My own shift is incomplete; you can find several of my git repositories at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/boud) .

See Fedeproxy at https://fedeproxy.eu for an ongoing project to enable easy communication across independent community-based software forges (such as git repository host servers).
